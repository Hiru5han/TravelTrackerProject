# Travel Tracker Project

**Why are we doing this?** 
To consolidate all that we have learnt and put them into practise. 
I have chosen to make a travel tracker as I feel that it is something that I would use when travelling.

**How I expected the challenge to go:** 
I'm expecting the challenge to present a number of blockers along the way but I expect to complete the project with a MVP.


**What went well? / What didn't go as planned?** 
I feel like there were very few things that went well, one of those would be getting the functionality I would want for the purpose of this application. Another positive would be the support I've received from the trainers and my teammates in diagnosing the many errors I've had. 

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.** 
Adding a date functionality would be a possible improvement in the future for the project.
