# Travel Tracker Project

**Why are we doing this?** 
To consolidate all that we have learnt and put them into practise. 
I have chosen to make a travel tracker as I feel that it is something that I would use when travelling.

**How I expected the challenge to go:** 
I'm expecting the challenge to present a number of blockers along the way but I expect to complete the project with a MVP.


**What went well? / What didn't go as planned?**
